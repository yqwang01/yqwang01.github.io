Hi friends, this is Yiqing Wang. I'm a Ph.D. candidate in [Sina Farsiu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=mzcr92sAAAAJ)'s [Vision and Image Processing Lab](https://people.duke.edu/~sf59/) of [Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://bme.duke.edu/) at [Duke University](https://duke.edu/). My research interest is deep-learning-based biomedical data processing, such as organ segmentation, disease diagnosis, image reconstruction, and image registration. I received my Bachelor's Degree in [Biomedical Engineering](http://en.bme.sjtu.edu.cn/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in June 2023. 

You can download my resume [here](https://yqwang01.github.io/files/resume_ENG.pdf).

欢迎访问我的网站，我是王一清，现在在[杜克大学](https://duke.edu/)[生物医学工程系](https://bme.duke.edu/)[Sina Farsiu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=mzcr92sAAAAJ)教授领导的[视觉与图像处理实验室](https://people.duke.edu/~sf59/)攻读博士学位。我的主要研究方向是基于深度学习的生物医学数据处理，例如器官分割、疾病诊断、图像重建，以及图像配准。我在2023年6月毕业于[上海交通大学](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/)[生物医学工程专业](https://bme.sjtu.edu.cn/)，取得工学学士学位。
