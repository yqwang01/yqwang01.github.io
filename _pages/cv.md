## Scholar experience

* **Aug. 2023 -- Present**: VIP Lab @ Duke directed by Sina Farsiu
  An Automated Quantitative Ulcer Analysis (AQUA) algorithm to classify Microbial keratitis (MK) organism types
  * Proposed a contrastive-learning-based method to extract robust features across different data patterns.
  * Developed a triple-stage multi-modality framework to integrate features of different modalities.
  * Expected to publish a journal article in 2025
    
  A multi-granularity language learning approach to boost visual understanding
  * Proposed a novel contrastive learning framework that enables simultaneous multi-label and cross-granularity alignment.
  * Provided a set of multi-label, multi-granularity learning objectives to enhance their visual understanding.
  * Submitted to \textit{ICCV 2025}.

* **Dec. 2022 – Jun. 2023**: IMIT @ SJTU directed by Lichi Zhang \
  A 2D/3D Registration Method for Full-length Images of Lower Limbs
  * Constructed the first 2D-3D registration network for X-rays and CT images of full-length lower limbs
  * Adopted the shifted-window self-attention and the cross-attention mechanism for efficient feature extraction
  * Proposed SigmoidDiceLoss, which makes the registration of discrete labels continuous and differentiable
